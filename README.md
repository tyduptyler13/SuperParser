SuperParser
====

Purpose
----
This project is designed for reading special files in a way that is as easy as possible for a tree structure to display. It also will be able to sort and filter based on the nodes it contains. 

Currently this work is in an Alpha stage and it should be expected to have bugs. To run the code it is recommended to start from console so that you can see the console output in case something breaks.

Tasks
----
* ~~Setup Data Structures~~
* ~~Basic File Reader~~
* ~~Display Data in GUI~~
* Finish getOutput methods (Formatted output)
* Improve GUI Display to show sub data
* Add filters
* Add Stats
* Add SuperParser Save format (Not needed but might add)

Adding functionality
----
You will need to add a class for your file type and implement the reader interface. For full integration
reference the STSReader class.
